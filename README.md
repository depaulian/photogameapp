# PhotoGame APP TM
A simple mobile application allows users to upload pictures that other users can vote up or vote down. 
current winner is the one whose pictures have been both viewed the  most and up-voted the most, and least down-voted.

## Onboarding
Registration is a simple process that involves entering a unique email and username. Asynchronous validation is performed like hitting a server to check the availability of a username or email as the user inputs a value in the email or password field. This way the user does not have to wait till he submits the form.

Login requires the username and password to match those in the backend database
